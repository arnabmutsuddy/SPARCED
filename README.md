# SPARCED Input Data

## Formatting

The data in these files are all tab-delimited between fields. This means that spaces can be used between elements in the same set, but tabs must be used to delineate columns

## Excel

This model originally had `.xlsx` file inputs, but was switched to `.txt` files for the sake of efficiency. If you have an excel file formatted to have the same number of columns as its associated `.txt` file in this folder, it can be converted using either Excel's built in save mechanisms or `excelToTSV.py`, which is in this folder
